# udemy_programowanie_obiektowe_w_python
These are exercises I've done during the udemy course: "Programowanie obiektowe w Python | Zadania + RozwiÄ…zania" created by Szymon Wolny. I've done them by myself.

ex. 2.6.py - The exercise was to create a class called "Employee" with atributes: name, surname, email, salary. I was asked to create "get_annual_salary" and "show_employee_information" methods too. The last thing to implement was a counter of Employee objects. I decided to create a list of objects instead of that and to return list length as my counter. I think the list would be useful if I'd like f.e. to give all employees 10% higher salary.
