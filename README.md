# udemy_programowanie_obiektowe_w_python
These are exercises I've done during the udemy course: "Programowanie obiektowe w Python | Zadania + RozwiÄ…zania" created by Szymon Wolny. I've done them by myself.

ex. 2.6.py - The exercise was to create a class called "Employee" with atributes: name, surname, email, salary. I was asked to create "get_annual_salary" and "show_employee_information" methods too. The last thing to implement was a counter of Employee objects. I decided to create a list of objects instead of that and to return list's length as my counter. I think the list would be useful if I'd like f.e. to give all employees 10% higher salary.

ex. 3.10.py - The exercise was about creating a class Library with methods and atributes which You can see in the code. The chapter was about getters and setters. I'm not completely satisfied with what I've got, however I still decided to put my result in the repository.

ex. 4.14.py - This exercise lies in inheritance. I had to create four classes with specific atributes and methods. 

ex. 5.22.py - Short exercise using __eq__ method. The program compares class MineralWater objects in terms of self.sodium and self.calcium atributes.

ex. 6.26.py - This exercise is about creating CustomDate objects by three ways.
